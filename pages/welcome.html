Come here to find e-books and audiobooks that I find culturally relevant, important, or just cool. Think of this as my own personal library, accessible to you.

                <h2>why?</h2>
                <p>The web is filled with an unimaginable amount of information. Sometimes it can be hard to navigate. Sometimes it can be hard to find the good stuff. Sometimes it's overwhelming and you don't know where to start. That's how I feel all the time on the web, so I decided to make a place where I keep my favourite literature.</p>
